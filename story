Once upon a time ,there lived a monkey on a jamoon tree ,which was on the banks of river.In the same forest,there lived a crocodile and h
his wife.One day,the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
Monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits,as he loved them.As days passed by,
crocodile and the monkey became good friends.

One day,the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife. she ate the fruits and liked them,but was 
jealous,as she does not like her husband spending so much time with the monkey. she told her husband,"if the fruits are
so juicy,I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be. Get me the heart of the monkey." The crocodile was not willing to
kill his friend,but had no choice.
